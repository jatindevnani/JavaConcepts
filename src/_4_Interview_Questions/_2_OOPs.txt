The four Concepts of Object Oriented Programming are -
1) Encapsulation -
    Encapsulation in java is a mechanism where the data members i.e. the variables of a class
    and the methods acting upon these variables are wrapped inside a single unit.
        In Encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can
    only be accessed through the public getter and setter methods. Therefore, it is also
    known as *data hiding*.

    To Achieve encapsulation,
        1) Mark the variables of the class as private
        2) Provide public getter and setter methods to read or write on these variables.

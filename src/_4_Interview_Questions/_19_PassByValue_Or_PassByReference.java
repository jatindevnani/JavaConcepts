    //Java always works as Pass by value and there is no such thing as pass by reference
    //Now what is pass by value you may ask?
    //Value in java always refers to the primitive value that is stored in the stack memory
    //For java objects, the stack stores the memory address of the object from heap.

    //When an object is passed to a new method.
    //The address value is copied into a new variable
    //and this variable is sent to the method
}

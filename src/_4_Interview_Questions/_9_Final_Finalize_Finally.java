    * All three keywords have their own utility while programming.

    *  Final: If any restriction is required for classes, variables, or methods, the final keyword comes in handy.
    *  Inheritance of a final class and overriding of a final method is restricted by the use of the final keyword.
    *  The variable value becomes fixed after incorporating the final keyword. Example:

    * Finally: It is the block present in a program where all the codes written inside it get executed irrespective
    *  of handling of exceptions.

     Finalize: Prior to the garbage collection of an object, the finalize method is called so that the clean-up
     *  activity is implemented.*/
